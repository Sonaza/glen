# Wot?

My practice/school work in creating a very basic OpenGL 3D (game) engine.

## Should I use this? Should I use it for an example?

1. Please do not use it, it's terrible code :) Some parts of it anyway.
2. If you use it as an example of how not to do things.

## Dependencies

glen uses SFML for windowing and inputs, GLEW, boost and stb_image.
